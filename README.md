## What is Pickup?
Our product is an app called PickUp that shows users pickup sports games in the Vanderbilt area, allowing them to join or create these games at their convenience. Users can choose a sport, a designated number of people, an area to play in, and even specify genders if they would like to. Our app provides users with a safe and convenient way to connect with other college students to play pickup games. Users can create and view games that are happening in the area, and they can also join games that are already created. Users can also chat with other users in the app to coordinate games. User will be able to add events into their google calender so that they can keep track of their games.
