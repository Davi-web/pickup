## What is Pickup?
Our product is an app called Pick Up that shows users  pickup sports games in the Vanderbilt area, allowing them to join or create these games at their convenience. Users can choose a sport, a designated number of people, an area to play in, and even specify genders if they would like to. Our app provides users with a safe and convenient way to connect with other college students to play pick up games. Users can create and view games that are happening in the area, and they can also join games that are already created. Users can also chat with other users in the app to coordinate games. User will be able to add events into their google calender so that they can keep track of their games.

## Frameworks using:
We used FIGMA to sketch out our initial wireframe. We used Next.js as our fullstack framework with react to build our frontend components. We used planetscale as our database provider and integrated easily within our app with the Prisma wrapper. We also used TRPC for our backend to achieve typesafety in our data models when referring them in our frontend and backend. Lastly, we used the ChatEngine API for the group chat functionality.
